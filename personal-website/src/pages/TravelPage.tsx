      <h1>COOL CONTENTS ON THE WAY!</h1>
      <p>On September 2, 2023 I took a one-way flight to Tehran, Iran, starting my 1.5 year long career break.
        I traveled to all countries by land in Central Asia plus Afghanistan and Pakistan (on a separate trip).
        I will be updating this page with my travel stories and photos.
        I will also be sharing my travel tips and recommendations for each country I visit.
